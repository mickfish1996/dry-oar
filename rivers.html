                <p id="salmon-p1">
                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with
                    the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                </p>
                <p id="salmon-p2">
                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
                    also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which 
                    tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                <p id="salmon-p3">
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed 
                    rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the 
                    early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but 
                    families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                <p id="desolation-p1">
                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows
                    towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great 
                    rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside 
                    Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric 
                    and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                <p id="desolation-p2">
                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                <p id="desolation-p3">
                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness 
                    and rich history that the canyon tells.

                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your 
                    visit to the Grand Canyon.

                <p id="grandCanyon-p2">
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly 
                    unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but 
                    with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

                <p id="grandCanyon-p3">
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
                    rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most 
                    people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
